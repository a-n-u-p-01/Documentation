### Core Java Concepts

1. **What is Java?**
   - Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. **What are the main features of Java?**
   - Key features include:
     - Object-oriented
     - Platform-independent (WORA - Write Once, Run Anywhere)
     - Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)
     - Strongly typed
     - Multithreaded
     - Secure

3. **Explain the JVM, JDK, and JRE.**
   - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** An engine that provides the runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
   - **JDK (Java Development Kit):** A software development kit that includes tools for developing Java applications (e.g., compilers, debuggers).
   - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** The part of the JDK that contains the libraries and JVM necessary to run Java applications.

4. **What is the difference between a JDK and a JRE?**
   - JDK is used for development, while JRE is used to run Java applications. JDK contains JRE.

5. **What are primitive data types in Java?**
   - Primitive data types include: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.

6. **What is a variable? What are the different types?**
   - A variable is a container for storing data values. Types include:
     - Local variables
     - Instance variables
     - Class variables (static)

7. **What is type casting in Java?**
   - Type casting is the conversion of one data type to another. It can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual).

8. **What are control statements in Java?**
   - Control statements include:
     - Conditional statements (if, switch)
     - Looping statements (for, while, do-while)
     - Jump statements (break, continue, return)

### Object-Oriented Programming

9. **What are the principles of OOP?**
   - The four main principles are:
     - Encapsulation
     - Abstraction
     - Inheritance
     - Polymorphism

10. **Explain encapsulation with an example.**
    - Encapsulation is bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). Example:
      ```java
      public class Person {
          private String name; // private variable

          public String getName() { // getter method
              return name;
          }

          public void setName(String name) { // setter method
              this.name = name;
          }
      }
      ```

11. **What is inheritance? How does it work?**
    - Inheritance allows one class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (superclass). It promotes code reusability. Example:
      ```java
      class Animal {
          void eat() {
              System.out.println("Eating...");
          }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
          void bark() {
              System.out.println("Barking...");
          }
      }
      ```

12. **What is polymorphism? Explain with examples.**
    - Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. Example:
      ```java
      class Animal {
          void sound() {
              System.out.println("Animal sound");
          }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
          void sound() {
              System.out.println("Bark");
          }
      }

      Animal myDog = new Dog();
      myDog.sound(); // Outputs: Bark
      ```

13. **What is method overriding and method overloading?**
    - **Method Overriding:** Redefining a method in a subclass that already exists in the superclass.
    - **Method Overloading:** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

14. **What is an abstract class? How is it different from an interface?**
    - An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without a body) as well as concrete methods. Interfaces can only declare methods and cannot have any implementation until Java 8 (which introduced default methods).

15. **What is an interface in Java?**
    - An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain method signatures and constants. Classes implement interfaces.

16. **Can a class implement multiple interfaces?**
    - Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritances of type.

### Exception Handling

17. **What is an exception?**
    - An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions, often caused by errors.

18. **What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**
    - **Checked Exceptions:** Must be either caught or declared in the method signature (e.g., IOException).
    - **Unchecked Exceptions:** Do not need to be explicitly handled (e.g., NullPointerException).

19. **How do you handle exceptions in Java?**
    - Exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks:
      ```java
      try {
          // code that may throw an exception
      } catch (ExceptionType e) {
          // handling code
      }
      ```

20. **What is the purpose of the `finally` block?**
    - The `finally` block is executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It's typically used for cleanup code.

21. **What is the `throw` keyword?**
    - The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception in your code.

22. **What is the `throws` keyword?**
    - The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to declare that a method may throw certain exceptions, allowing the calling method to handle them.

### Java Collections Framework

23. **What is the Java Collections Framework?**
    - A set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures, providing operations to manipulate collections.

24. **What are the differences between List, Set, and Map?**
    - **List:** Ordered collection that allows duplicates (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
    - **Set:** Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
    - **Map:** Collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).

25. **Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList.**
    - **ArrayList:** Resizable array, allows random access, better for indexing.
    - **LinkedList:** Doubly linked list, better for insertion and deletion operations.

26. **What is a HashMap?**
    - A HashMap is a part of Java's collection framework and stores data in key-value pairs. It allows null values and one null key.

27. **What are iterators? How do you use them?**
    - An iterator is an object that enables you to traverse a collection. Example:
      ```java
      List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
      Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
      while (iterator.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(iterator.next());
      }
      ```

28. **What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?**
    - HashMap is non-synchronized and allows null values, while Hashtable is synchronized and does not allow null values.

29. **What is the difference between TreeSet and HashSet?**
    - TreeSet is ordered and sorted based on natural ordering or a comparator, while HashSet is unordered.

### Multithreading

30. **What is a thread?**
    - A thread is a lightweight process that allows concurrent execution of code within a program.

31. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**
    - A process is an independent program in execution, while a thread is a smaller unit of a process that shares the same memory space.

32. **What is synchronization?**
    - Synchronization in Java is a mechanism that ensures that multiple threads can safely access shared resources or critical sections of code without leading to data inconsistency or unexpected behavior

33. **What is a deadlock?**
    - A deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.

34. **How do you create a thread in Java?**
    - You can create a thread by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. Example:
      ```java
      class MyThread extends Thread {
          public void run() {
              System.out.println("Thread is running");
          }
      }
      MyThread t = new MyThread();
      t.start();
      ```

35. **What is the purpose of the `volatile` keyword?**
    - The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.

### Java 8 Features

36. **What are default methods in interfaces?**
    - Default methods allow you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementations. They are defined using the `default` keyword.

37. **What are streams in Java?**
    - Streams are sequences of data that can be processed in a functional style. They allow operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on collections.

38. **What is Optional?**
    - `Optional` is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. It helps in avoiding `NullPointerExceptions`.

### Annotations and Reflection

39. **What are Java annotations?**
    - Annotations provide metadata about the program and can be used for compile-time checking, runtime processing, and more.

40. **What is reflection in Java?**
    - Reflection is the ability to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, and fields at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior.

### Performance and Memory Management

41. **What is the Java Memory Model?**
    - The Java Memory Model defines how threads interact through memory and what behaviors are allowed in concurrent execution.

42. **What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?**
    - Memory areas include:
      - Heap
      - Stack
      - Method Area
      - Program Counter Register
      - Native Method Stack

43. **What is garbage collection? How does it work?**
    - Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.

### Design Patterns

44. **What is a Singleton pattern?**
    - The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

45. **What is the Factory pattern?**
    - The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects.

### Miscellaneous

46. **What is the difference between == and .equals()?**
    - `==` checks for reference equality (whether both references point to the same object), while `.equals()` checks for value equality (whether the objects are logically equivalent).

47. **What are immutable objects?**
    - Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created. In Java, strings are immutable.

48. **What is the purpose of the `static` block?**
    - A `static` block is used for static initializations of a class. It runs once when the class is loaded.

49. **What is the `transient` keyword?**
    - The `transient` keyword is used in serialization to indicate that a field should not be serialized.

50. **What are enums in Java?**
    - Enums are a special type of class that represents a group of constants. They provide type safety and can have methods and fields.
