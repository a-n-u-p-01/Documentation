### Basic Concepts

1. **What is JavaScript?**
   - A high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications alongside HTML and CSS.

2. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**
   - **Primitive Types:**
     - `String`: Represents text.
     - `Number`: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point.
     - `Boolean`: Represents a logical value (`true` or `false`).
     - `Null`: Represents an intentional absence of any object value.
     - `Undefined`: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
     - `Symbol`: A unique and immutable data type often used as object property keys.
     - `BigInt`: An arbitrary precision integer type for large integers.
   - **Reference Types:**
     - `Object`: A collection of key-value pairs.
     - `Array`: A special type of object for ordered lists.
     - `Function`: A callable object that can be invoked.

3. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
   - **`var`**: 
     - ~~Function-scoped or globally scoped.~~
     - Can be re-declared and updated.
   - **`let`**: 
     - Block-scoped (confined within the nearest enclosing block).
     - Can be updated but not re-declared in the same block.
   - **`const`**: 
     - Block-scoped.
     - Cannot be re-declared or updated; must be initialized at declaration.

4. **Explain `hoisting` in JavaScript.**
   - Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This allows you to use functions and variables before their actual declaration in the code.

5. **What are `undefined` and `null`?**
   - **`undefined`**: A variable that is declared but not assigned a value, indicating the absence of value.
   - **`null`**: A value that indicates intentional absence of any object value, often used as a placeholder.

6. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
   - **`==`**: Equality operator that performs type coercion, converting types if necessary.
   - **`===`**: Strict equality operator that checks both value and type without coercion.

7. **What is a function in JavaScript? How do you define one?**
   - A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. It can be defined using the `function` keyword or as an arrow function:
     ```javascript
     function myFunction() { /* code */ }
     const 
     myArrowFunction = () => { /* code */ };
     ```

### Functions and Scope

8. **What is a first-class function?**
   - Functions treated as first-class citizens in JavaScript, allowing them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

9. ~~**Explain the concept of closures.**~~
   - A **closure** is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, meaning it can use variables from its outer function even after that outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to maintain state and access those variables later.
### Traditional Functions vs. Arrow Functions

1. **Syntax:**
   - Traditional:
     ```javascript
     function myFunction(param) {
       return param * 2;
     }
     ```
   - Arrow:
     ```javascript
     const myFunction = (param) => param * 2;
     ```

2. ~~**`this` Binding:**~~
   - Traditional: `this` is determined by how the function is called.
   - Arrow: `this` is lexically bound from the surrounding scope.

3. **Arguments Object:**
   - Traditional: Has access to the `arguments` object.
     ```javascript
     function traditionalFunction() {
       console.log(arguments); // [1, 2, 3]
     }
     ```
   - Arrow: Does not have its own `arguments` object; use rest parameters instead.
     ```javascript
     const arrowFunction = (...args) => {
       console.log(args); // [1, 2, 3]
     };
     ```

4. **Use Cases:**
   - Traditional: Use when you need a separate `this` context or the `arguments` object.
   - Arrow: Use for concise syntax and when you want to preserve `this`.

10. **What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?**
	    - A function that is executed immediately after its creation, usually defined with the following syntax:
      ```javascript
      (function() { /* code */ })();
      ```

11. **What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**
    - Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and do not have their own `this`, making them lexically bind `this` from the surrounding code.

12. **What is scope, and what are the different types of scope in JavaScript?**
    - Scope determines variable visibility. Types include:
      - **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function are available globally.
      - **Function Scope**: Variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function.
      - **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` within a block (e.g., within `{}`) are only accessible within that block.

13. **What is the `this` keyword?**
    - Refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value can change based on how the function is called (e.g., method call, function call, constructor call).

### Objects and Arrays

14. **How do you create an object in JavaScript?**
    - Using object literal notation:
      ```javascript
      const obj = { key: value };
      ```
    - Or using the `new Object()` syntax:
      ```javascript
      const obj = new Object();
      ```

15. **What is the difference between an object and an array?**
    - Objects store key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols), while arrays are ordered collections of values indexed by numbers.

16. **How can you add or remove properties from an object?**
    - **Add**:
      ```javascript
      obj.newKey = value;
      ```
    - **Remove**:
      ```javascript
      delete obj.key;
      ```

17. **Explain the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods on arrays.**
    - **`map()`**: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.
      ```javascript
      const newArray = arr.map(element => element * 2);
      ```
    - **`filter()`**: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.
      ```javascript
      const filteredArray = arr.filter(element => element > 10);
      ```
    - **`reduce()`**: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
      ```javascript
      const sum = arr.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);
      ```

18. **How do you check if a property exists in an object?**
    - Using the `in` operator:
      ```javascript
      if ('key' in obj) { /* exists */ }
      ```
    - Or using `hasOwnProperty()`:
      ```javascript
      if (obj.hasOwnProperty('key')) { /* exists */ }
      ```

19. **How can you merge two objects?**
    - Using `Object.assign()`:
      ```javascript
      const merged = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
      ```
    - Or using the spread operator:
      ```javascript
      const merged = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
      ```

### Asynchronous JavaScript

Synchronous JavaScript
- **Execution**: Code runs line by line. Each statement is executed in order, and the next statement waits for the current one to complete.
Asynchronous JavaScript
- **Execution**: Tasks can be initiated and allowed to run in the background, enabling the program to continue executing other code without waiting for the task to complete.
1. **What are callbacks in JavaScript?**
    - Functions passed as arguments that are executed after an asynchronous operation completes, allowing you to handle results or errors.

2. **What are Promises, and how do they work?**
    - Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. They allow chaining with `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for error handling.

3. **What is `async/await`?**
    - A syntax for working with Promises that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, improving readability.
      ```javascript
      async function fetchData() {
          try {
              const response = await fetch(url);
              const data = await response.json();
          } catch (error) {
              console.error(error);
          }
      }
      ```

23. **How can you handle errors in asynchronous code?**
    - Using `.catch()` for Promises:
      ```javascript
      promiseFunction().then(result => { /* handle result */ }).catch(error => { /* handle error */ });
      ```
    - Using `try/catch` blocks with `async/await`:
      ```javascript
      try {
          const result = await asyncFunction();
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
      }
      ```

24. ~~**What is the Event Loop?**~~
    - A mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations by using a single thread. It manages the execution of code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.

### DOM Manipulation

25. **What is the DOM?**
    - The Document Object Model is a programming interface that represents HTML and XML documents as a tree structure, enabling scripts to manipulate the document's structure, style, and content.

26. **How can you select an element in the DOM?**
    - Using methods like:
      - `document.getElementById('id')`
      - `document.querySelector('.class')`
      - `document.getElementsByClassName('className')`
      - `document.querySelectorAll('selector')`

27. **What are event listeners, and how do you use them?**
    - Functions that execute in response to specific events (e.g., clicks, key presses) attached to DOM elements using:
      ```javascript
      element.addEventListener('event', handler);
      ```

28. **What is event delegation?**
    - A technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element, which handles events for multiple child elements. This improves performance and reduces memory usage.

29. **How do you create and remove an element in the DOM?**
    - **Create**:
      ```javascript
      const newElement = document.createElement('div');
      parentElement.appendChild(newElement);
      ```
    - **Remove**:
      ```javascript
      element.remove(); // or
      parentElement.removeChild(childElement);
      ```

### ES6 and Beyond

30. **What are template literals?**
    - String literals that allow embedded expressions, making string interpolation easier using backticks (`` ` ``):
      ```javascript
      const name = 'World';
      const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
      ```

31. **Explain destructuring in JavaScript.**
    - A syntax that allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables:
      ```javascript
      const arr = [1, 2, 3];
      const [a, b] = arr; // a = 1, b = 2
      const obj = { x: 1, y: 2 };
      const { x, y } = obj; // x = 1, y = 2
      ```

32. **What is the spread operator?**
    - A syntax (`...`) that expands iterable elements into individual elements, useful for creating copies of arrays/objects or combining them:
      ```javascript
      const arr1 = [1, 2];
      const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]
      ```

33. **What are modules in JavaScript?**
    - Code organized into separate files, allowing for encapsulation and export/import of functionalities. This promotes better code organization and reusability.

34. **What is the purpose of `import` and `export`?**
    - **`export`**: Makes functions, objects, or primitives available for use in other modules:
      ```javascript
      export const myFunction = () => { /* code */ };
      ```
    - **`import`**: Allows you to use exported functions or variables from other modules:
      ```javascript
      import { myFunction } from './myModule.js';
      ```

### Miscellaneous

35. **What is prototypal inheritance?**
    - A feature in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through a prototype chain, enabling reuse of code.

36. **How do you debug JavaScript code?**
    - Using browser developer tools, console logs (`console.log()`), breakpoints, and debugging statements to inspect code execution and variable states.

37. **What are higher-order functions?**
    - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as output. They enable functional programming patterns.

38. **~~What are the common design patterns in JavaScript?**~~
    - **Module Pattern**: Encapsulates private data and exposes public methods.
    - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
    - **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
    - **Observer Pattern**: Allows a subject to notify observers about changes in its state.

39. **What is a closure and how does it work?**
    - A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope's variables even after the outer function has executed. It is commonly used to create private variables.

40. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**
    - **Synchronous Programming**: Executes tasks sequentially, blocking further execution until the current task completes.
    - **Asynchronous Programming**: Allows tasks to run concurrently, enabling non-blocking operations, which can improve performance and responsiveness.

### Best Practices

41. **What are some common coding conventions in JavaScript?**
    - Use meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and adhere to a style guide (e.g., Airbnb, Google). Comment code wisely and keep it organized.

42. **How do you write clean and maintainable code?**
    - Keep functions small and focused, use meaningful names, structure code logically, and follow consistent coding styles. Write documentation for complex functions.

43. **What is the importance of code comments?**
    - Comments help explain the purpose and functionality of code, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand it later. They should be used to clarify complex logic.

            if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
                merged.push(arr1[i++]);
            } else {
                merged.push(arr2[j++]);
            }
